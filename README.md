Notebooks for the [2021 course on Large Scale Machine Learning at Mines ParisTech](http://cazencott.info/index.php/pages/LSML-21-Large-Scale-Machine-Learning).

## Day 1: Introduction to large scale ML
* If you are familiar with `scikit-learn` (for example, Mines students who had Data Science in their first year or took S1333-5 previously), work on notebook `1_sklearn_at_scale.ipynb`.
* If you are not familiar with `scikit-learn`, you can start with [this notebook](https://github.com/chagaz/ml-notebooks/tree/master/intro-ml-genetics) to get a hang of things. 

## Day 2: Deep learning
* If you have never trained convolutional neural networks on `keras`, start with [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kLEraNaAreY0MGZisTx4phvAqv7p58gl?usp=sharing) to train a LeNet Deep Convolutional Network on MNIST. 
* Practice transfer-learning using a standard ConvNet pre-trained on ImageNet with [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SadnM3Hnklj5vQQX9N4gIWNmt_0ITHwo?usp=sharing)
* Practice unsupervised deep learning with auto-encoders and GAN with [this notebook](https://github.com/JosephGesnouin/Unsup_gener_nets/blob/main/TP_modeles_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ratifs.ipynb)
Beginners should work on TP1 (LeNet on MNIST), and then at least begin TP3 (Deep Generative Models)
Students who have already practised with Deep ConvNets should work essentially on TP3. TP2 may be useful only for those who have never practised Transfer Learning.
